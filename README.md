# Robux Saver

A simple Chrome extension that saves 40% of your Robux.

# What does this extension do?

This extension essentially reads the amount of Robux you have on your profile via the [V1 Economy API](https://economy.roblox.com/docs/index.html), and takes 40% of the Robux away visually. **Extra content TBD.**

# Motivation

For a while now, I have seen multiple Roblox extensions use the 'Group Method' to save on Robux. However, this comes at a cost; that being the fact Roblox can patch this method at any point in time if they decide to do so.
